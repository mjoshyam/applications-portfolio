# Emotion-Language-and-Interpretable-Personas
This project explores how emotions show up in everyday language, and how computational models interpret those expressions. Rather than treating emotions as simple labels, the work views emotion as something people express through language choices—including narrative style, time orientation, and social framing. Using a curated set of 68 emotion concepts drawn from Tiffany Watt Smith’s The Book of Human Emotions, the project examines how emotionally meaningful language clusters across different contexts. Smith’s concepts are not used as labels, but as interpretive guides to understand patterns already present in the data. 
Through a combination of semantic similarity, linguistic cue analysis, and unsupervised clustering, the project develops a small set of interpretable personas that reflect different ways people process uncertainty, threat, loss, and social comparison. The goal of this work is not prediction but understanding how emotional meaning is structured in language, how models represent that structure, and where those representations fall short. The project is motivated by interests in language, cognition, and human-centered AI design.
