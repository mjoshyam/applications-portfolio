1,Despair,Emptiness,"From the Latin de (without) sperare (hope), despair means losing hope of ever finding meaning in life. In the early twentieth century Existentialists saw despair as a fundamental condition of living in a universe without fate, without God and without purpose. They saw despair as both painful and liberating. For Albert Camus, the Greek myth of Sisyphus expressed this optimistic aspect of despair. The mortal Sisyphus, for his impudence and overreaching, is condemned to a hopeless labour. He must roll a huge stone up a slope, until at the top the rock rolls back down, at which point Sisyphus must begin to push it up again. Most of us might imagine weeping in frustration, and then, on realising that the task will never end, falling backwards into a dark silence. But for Camus, it was by losing hope in ever finding a meaning that Sisyphus became free. His fate is simply the sum of his actions. Rather than giving up, he simply adjusts to the pointlessness of it all. And out of his despair at the futility of his predicament, a strange lightness comes. He becomes, writes Camus, 'stronger than his rock'.",,,,,,,,,
2,Grief,Emptiness,"The confusion and pain of grief is so personal, so unfathomable. If we are lucky, profound grief is something we'll experience only a few times in our lives, so it is nearly always disorientating. We may feel a debilitating SHOCK. We may experience a peculiar stiffness as if all emotion has been suspended. There may be RELIEF that a terminally ill loved one is no longer suffering, gratitude that our burden of care is over there may be sHAME at these feelings too. C. S. Lewis described, following the death of his wife in 1950, experiencing a l permanently provisional feeling. It doesn't seem worth starting anything. I cant settle down. I yawn. I fidget ... I am beginning to understand why grief feels like suspense? We commonly refer to different 'stages' of grief. Denial comes first. Then ANGeR, bargaining, depression. Finally comes acceptance. This 'five stages of grief' model can be traced back to the Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in the late 1960s. We might increasingly wonder how helpful this rigid model may be (Kübler-Ross herself wasn't so sure). For many of us, moving from denial to acceptance involves more of an ebb and flow. For others, grief is an endlessly circular process, something we never really 'get over' - even if we do learn to live with it.",,,,,,,,,
3,Acedia,Emptiness,"Imagine you're a Christian hermit, living in the deserts of western Egypt in the fourth century. The sun beats down on the roof of your mud-brick cell. Inside, you re praying, kneeling upon a carpet of stones - when you start to feel a little bit bored. It's a distracting, creeping feeling. Like the tickle of a gnat crawling up your arm. You must defeat it, or else, risk succumbing to that most dangerous of all sinful passions: acedia. Acedia (pronounced a-seed-ee-a) or sometimes called accidie, is an emotion that has no real equivalent today. It was a disastrous emotional crisis, usually striking between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m, when the midday heat would be at its worst. Its first signs were listlessness and irritability, but it didn't take long to turn into desolation and despair. The Desert Mothers and Fathers believed it was sent by the Devil's minions, known as 'noonday demons. In the sixth century, acedia was dropped from the list of mortal sins. Some of its symptoms were absorbed into the illness melancholia, a forerunner to our own states of depression and anxiety (see: MELANCHOLY). The rest became the moral vice sloth.",,,,,,,,,
4,Hatred,Emptiness,"It was in the 1980s that American journalists first coined the term 'hate crime' to describe a wave of attacks on people of marginalised groups. In the 1990s, western Europe experienced a similar outbreak of violence fuelled by intolerance and prejudice, and introduced its own 'hate-crime legislation'. The word 'hate' does not appear in the legislation itself; but it is governments, police spokespeople and journalists who speak of 'hate-fuelled violence'. Some legal scholars say this emotive language is deliberately inflammatory, making it possible to give tougher sentences: it is, it seems, easier to punish someone for their irrational emotions, than for their beliefs. Those who defend the terminology argue that it's the hatred which is toxic and which inflames the desire to humiliate victims, not some reasoned belief. Can you punish an emotion? Is there even an objective measure for it? Hatred may be the focus of legal and philosophical argument, but in the meantime, it has become a byword for all that is contemptible, intolerant and anti-social in our societies.",,,,,,,,,
5,Zal,Emptiness,"The life of composer Frédéric Chopin was lived in the sharp twists and bitter resentments that come when we lose everything. His exile from Poland, his turbulent relationship with the novelist George Sand, his frail health which forced him to withdraw from society of others, the strange episodes of delirium foreshadowing the consumption that killed him at thirty-nine. For Chopin, it was the untranslatable Polish emotion Żal that produced the morbid intensity we can still hear in his work, arguably the most haunting piano music ever created. It was, according to Chopin's friend and biographer Franz Liszt, the 'soil of his heart'. Zal (pronounced jahl) is melancholy felt at an irretrievable loss. This is not a straightforward dejection. Zal is fickle, and shifts its shape, at one moment resigned, the next rebellious. It combines the DISAPPOINTMENT, REGRET and even violent fury which comes when some part of our lives has been taken away for good. Chopin's Zal, wrote Liszt, found its greatest expression in the composer's later works - the Etudes and Scherzos, which speak of a despair, 'sometimes ironic, sometimes disdainfully proud, of recognising the end of things.",,,,,,,,,
6,Disgust,Bitterness,"You smell sour milk and your nose wrinkles. You accidentally touch dog poo and your gorge rises. It's the quick-as-a-flash electric current, running from noxious substance to revolted feeling, which makes disgust so fascinating. You encounter a poison and your body refuses it. It's simple, life-saving even. But little is further from the truth. The sense that something is 'out of place' might be more important to provoking feelings of disgust than the objectively dangerous. Those odd little glitches, where the stomach heaves in response to some object we know can't hurt us. The hair in the mouth, or the skin on a mug of hot milk, or the soup clinging to a man's beard which might make us bilious. What we speak of as 'disgust' describes so many different kinds of responses - the vomitous feeling of seeing rotten meat, the nauseating horror on seeing a person's skin flapping open, even a feeling of moral queasiness. As with so many of our emotions, it's not easy to tell where disgust begins and ends. After all, disgust arises more powerfully when boundaries dissolve, meaning breaks down and things slide 'out of place'",,,,,,,,,
7,Jealousy,Bitterness,"We are heirs to a strange and conflicted history of jealousy, shaped almost entirely by gender. The idea that jealousy was the natural response to infidelity was consolidated through a series of legal cases. In 1670 John Manning caught his wife with another man, and then beat him to death. He was sentenced to be branded 'gently' on the hand - 'because there could not be greater provocation than this. Thirty-seven years later, a judge declared jealousy 'the rage of a man, and adultery the highest invasion of property. With jealousy defined as a natural masculine emotion inevitably experienced when one's property was threatened, the murder charge was downgraded to manslaughter. In Britain the provocation of infidelity is no longer admitted as a defence in court, although judges still show sympathy to murderers who cite jealousy as a reason to kill. As long as people have relationships and wandering eyes, jealousy will always exist. But what we can change is its status as an emotion that justifies violence. Not least because it's not just men who succumb to it. We all do.",,,,,,,,,
8,Envy,Bitterness,"Most cultures have their traditions of the Evil Eye, a gaze motivated by envy, which poisons, curses or brings misfortune. JEALOUSY, which is above all a fear of losing a loved one to another, is often credited with some romantic appeal. The same cannot be said of envy. Envy is feared not only because it gives rise to a greedy desire to steal the admired object but because it is destructive and, left to fester, it turns to HATRED and maliciousness. But, could there be something of value in the impulse to want what others have? Those who live on the Pacific atoll of the Ifaluk speak of Song, the anger caused when someone fails to share properly, and consider it a perfectly reasonable response. Since the mid-1990s, neuroscientists have argued that our emotions underpin even our most rational ideas, helping us weigh up our choices. Sometimes the belief that others have it much better than we do is a mere trick of the light. But many have an awful lot less than they deserve. A twinge of envy might just be an emotional antenna alerting you to some disparity or inequality not too far away. Whether you decide to respond with destructive fury or something a little more creative is, of course, up to you.",,,,,,,,,
9,Self-Pity,Bitterness,The philosopher Max Scheler wrote that self-pity demands an imaginative tour de force: we must stand outside ourselves in a fantastic doubling. The person who feels sorry for himself regards himself as if he were someone else, wrote Scheler, and looks down upon this helpless being, shedding a tear for the unfairness of their pathetic situation. When things don't go our way, one half of us gets to feel superior, enjoying the RELIEF that pitying someone else can bring. Self-pity can be little more than a short and pleasurable indulgence, but sometimes, we become stuck with our feelings of unfairness. Self-pity brings our horizons so claustrophobically near that other people's viewpoints become impossible for us to imagine. Not only do we loathe ourselves," but we can't bear anyone else either. Frustrated families and friends have used all kinds of techniques to try to snap their loved ones out of the absorption of self-pity. One technique is suggested by recent research on altruism. Encourage your own beloved to perform small and random acts of kindness towards strangers and they might just rediscover compassion - and find some kindness for themselves too.""",
10,Remorse,Bitterness,"We live in what has been dubbed an 'Age of Apology - from politicians formally apologising for atrocities committed by their predecessors, to South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Such apologies can seem inadequate, with the 'performative' aspect making them vulnerable to questions about sincerity. Did Tony Blair really feel remorse for the actions of a nineteenth-century Conservative government, or was his apology just a move in the Irish Peace Process chess game? The question of whether remorse was a passion or an intellectual position was debated between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries in Europe. Medieval theologians argued that true remorse was a voluntary desire to make amends and a willingness to go through a painful process of penitence. It was only in a quiet state of mind that the penitent could calculate the correct level of penitence required to neutralise the sin. Perhaps the next time we hope to see a politician's eyes glisten our question should not be whether remorse is being truly felt, but whether it is being genuinely thought.",,,,,,,,,
11,Regret,Bitterness,"There's something so seductive about regret. The way it paints an aura of possibility around what has been broken - even seeming to mend it momentarily with 'what ifs'. Though regret is rarely a comfortable state of mind, it also contains a flicker of pleasure and a strange, if temporary, sort of RELIEF. The hardest regrets usually arrive when our own behaviour jars with aspects of our identities we hold most dear. Those parts of ourselves which we cling on to most forcefully are usually the ones created in defence of some much earlier failure or criticism. If you've made the effort to prove it wrong, seeing your own decisions or actions stack up in its favour can be painful. More often than not, what at the time seems an inconsolable loss is not the end of the story. Perhaps we'll adjust ourselves to our regrets. Perhaps we'll learn from them. But unlike resignation or acceptance, regret is ultimately a kind of desire for something different to have happened. It makes the mind waver, it gnaws. And by allowing us to imagine the possibility of things ending differently, it contains, rather peculiarly, a little germ of hope.",,,,,,,,,
12,Litost,Loathing,"Litost (pronounced lee-tost) is a Czech emotion describing the SHAME, RESENTMENT and fury felt when another has made us feel wretched. As Czech author Milan Kundera puts it in his Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1979), litost is 'a state of torment caused by the sudden sight of one's own misery ... First comes a feeling of torment, then the desire for revenge? Litost's VENGEFULNESS is often self-destructive. A cutting retort might be enough to restore our PRIDE, but when we're hurt by those wielding power over us, revenge must take circuitous routes. In Kundera's novel, a child is belittled by his violin teacher for playing the wrong note. The child deliberately repeats the mistake until the teacher snaps and throws the pupil out of the window. 'As he falls, writes Kundera, 'the child is delighted by the thought that the nasty teacher will be charged with murder.' The goal of litost is to make the other person 'look as miserable as oneself', your attention so focused on punishing your tormentor that your own destruction becomes far less important.",,,,,,,,,
13,Guilt,Loathing,"Guilt is a ghoulish sort of queasy sensation which keeps reappearing. We can speak of feeling guilty, yet in the same breath imply we've done nothing wrong. Some people take too little responsibility, others too much. The phrase 'having a guilt complex' became a voguish diagnosis in the early twentieth century. As psychotherapist Alfred Adler put it in 1927, the guilt complex is a 'combination of self-accusation and repentance', which strives for superiority on the useless side of life'. Even guilt itself, with its whirring obsession with self-punishment and blame, was a kind of avoidance: we feel guilty instead of doing what we know we ought. This Adlerian vision of guilt has been very influential in the modern self-help movement, in which guilt is seen to be the enemy of productivity and personal fulfilment. Most of us find ourselves stuck in interminable conversations with ourselves. Was it our fault? Or theirs? Should we take more responsibility? Or less? The truth usually lies somewhere between. It's less a question of making guilt vanish than adjusting to its background hum.",,,,,,,,,
14,Resentment,Loathing,"The vision of resentment as a petty emotion found its clearest expression in the work of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. He argued that the origins of European civilisation lay in a golden age, which celebrated noble rage and swift VENGEFULNESS. At some point during the Roman Empire, Nietzsche thought that this 'master morality' was replaced by the 'slave morality'. He argued that the slaves of the Roman Empire suffered under the contemptuous treatment of their masters, but were unable to express their indignation for FEAR of reprisal. According to Nietzsche, it was this attitude which characterised resentiment, and which Jewish, and later, Christian, religious teachings perpetuated with their vision of patient suffering on earth. Some cultures recognise this long-held resentment and the strange effects it can produce as a distinctive part of their emotional life (see: LITOST). And those long and patient years of suffering and fantasising about revenge etch scars into our emotional landscapes. This is why Nietzsche, though he disliked ressentiment intensely, believed it was only by developing it that 'the human soul became deep'.",,,,,,,,,
15,Schadenfreude,Loathing,"The unexpected thrill we feel at another's misfortune is a deliciously clandestine human pleasure. Schadenfreude - from the German Schaden (harm) and Freude (pleasure) - is an illicit enjoyment of another's bad luck, as opposed to the more forthright scorn or gloating. The Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius believed our DELIGHT in another's struggle was not a sign of moral bankruptcy. We enjoy standing safely on the shore watching a boat tossed about on a stormy sea, he wrote, because 'it is sweet to perceive from what misfortunes you yourself are free.. In truth, we devour other people's misery for a ragbag of reasons: rivalry, ENVY, RESENTMENT, distraction ... Seeing our competitors fall flat on their faces is gratifying because we think that our own stock goes up when theirs goes down. Part of us wants to see them punished, so our own status can be restored. Few of us care to admit it, but we get a kick out of hearing about other people's bad decisions, errant spouses and ungrateful children. It reminds us that it's not only our own hopes that get dashed. Everybody else's do too.",,,,,,,,,
16,Shame,Loathing,"While guilt is an emotion associated with hearing the wheedling voice of conscience, shame is usually associated with wanting to hide. But you don't need to get caught taking a fiver from your flatmate's purse or in flagrante with your married next-door neighbour to want to shut yourself away forever... We may feel embarrassed about things we've done, but shame is about who we are. Since the Stonewall Riots of 1969, women and men have marched under the banner of gay pride. Its premise is clear: in the face of intolerance, it's only by being seen that we can feel whole. More recent theorists of sexuality have questioned this emphasis on PRIDE, wondering if it might bleach out other parts of homosexual life, which might seem rather more embarrassing, even undignified. They have initiated a gay shame' movement. One of its legacies may be a willingness to talk about shame - and the moments of awkwardness and transgression that cause it - as a valuable emotion, rather than the damaging, toxic one we've come to think of it as. It might be that to forge identity in the face of disapproval, the existence of shame must be recognised - even celebrated.",,,,,,,,,
17,Disappointment,Loathing,"Disappointment - meaning to be 'deprived of an appointment', to be 'dispossessed' - has a long history of making trouble. But in the early twentieth century psychologists began to argue that it could be crucial for healthy mental development. Sigmund Freud spoke of 'narcissistic wounds', the painful assaults on our sense of identity when fantasies are punctured. He coined the phrase 'the family romance' to describe those stories told to us as we grow up that give a dramatic importance to our arrival in the world. According to Freud it was vital that we ultimately let such fantasies go in order to engage with reality. As the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein put it, to move forward and develop authentic relationships, everyone must come to the aching realisation that 'no really ideal part of the self exists' The psychoanalytic story of disappointment is ultimately optimistic. But when we suffer the painful loss of an idealised self-image, what's left isn't necessarily 'the truth but emptiness and confusion. As Wordsworth put it in The Prelude, 'a sense of treachery and desertion in the place / The holiest that I knew of - my own soul.",,,,,,,,,
18,Terror,Angst,"The nineteenth-century Italian physician Angelo Mosso observed among soldiers that 'in terror, even the most intrepid men do not think of flight; it seems as though the nerves of defence were severed and they were left to their fate'. For some this frozen sensation could be poetic and thrilling. The Swiss painter Henry Fuseli thought terror was an ennobling, even purifying emotion (see: FEAR). According to the philosopher Edmund Burke, vast mountainous landscapes could assail walkers, provoking the violence of 'terror and wonder' in their hearts. Even if this rich poetic inheritance is no longer part of contemporary political rhetoric about acts of, and wars, on terror, the sense of paralysis is still with us. Learn that a terror, rather than a fear, threatens you, and you might feel cowed and overwhelmed. In the face of shadowy, elusive forces self-defence seems futile. It's then that, like Mosso's terrified soldiers, we become voiceless and rooted to the spot. And might find ourselves incapable of arguing, when someone else seeks retribution on our behalf.",,,,,,,,,
19,Dread,Angst,"One of the most terrifying things about the Great Pestilence that swept Europe in 1348-9 must have been sensing it approach. Pilgrims and travellers spread news of desolate streets and wretched survivors. Cities locked their gates and their inhabitants performed desperate acts of penitence. Many believed they were witnessing the world's end. Unlike FEAR OF PANIC, which is usually triggered by an immediate threat, dread is the cold unease felt in the approaching shadow of a menace about which we can do little. In its earliest uses, it described a feeling of being rendered speechless and prostrate in the presence of God's awesome power. For this reason, Rastafarians dubbed themselves Dreads, and their matted hair, dreadlocks. In the age of the internet, mild dread may be a low-level hum for us all. It's harder than ever to remain ignorant each time a new pandemic appears. And since dread can feed off rumour and misinformation, the internet provides the ideal petri dish. Some might panic and start stockpiling drugs, while governments conduct health-checks at our borders. But for most there is little option but to sink backwards into a cold helplessness - and hope it doesn't come too near.",,,,,,,,,
20,Anxiety,Angst,"The stomach lurches and the throat tightens. The eyes twitch and the mind zig-zags across endless possibilities. Unlike FEAR Or WORRY, which usually have a defined cause, anxiety buzzes hungrily around life's problems, alighting on ordinary troubles and turning them into visions of disaster. Pills and potions, exercises and meditations are offered to calm the anxious mind and make it 'free'. In the post-war 1940s, the poet W. H. Auden was moved to speak of an 'Age of Anxiety', while the governments of Britain and the United States employed psychologists to measure and improve the population's serenity' and 'security'. By the time Miltown, the first of the blockbuster tranquillisers, hit the market in 1955, anxiety had become a multimillion-dollar industry. Today, anxiety is once more on the rise, and the most commonly diagnosed disorder in the United States. But, for the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, angst was the appropriate response to realising life is not predetermined. Only the 'most spiritless have lived without anxiety', he proclaimed. So he would probably be alarmed to see how we treat anxiety today, as something to be freed from, rather than evidence of the terror of freedom itself.",,,,,,,,,
21,Fear,Angst,"Fear is one of the most primal of human emotions. The body's involuntary fight or flight response to threat might be one of our greatest allies - such reactions evolved to preserve the life of our species - yet we depict it as a furtive enemy, derailing rational thought, inflaming latent anxieties. Terrified stampedes and desperate crushes can still kill us, and panic attacks can make us feel as if we might be dying (see: PANIC). In the West we live in 'fear-averse' societies. Our public spaces may be festooned with security cameras and warnings to be vigilant, but these repeated exhortations to reduce risk may increase our nervousness. Continually reminded of our vulnerabilities, we may become more susceptible to political rhetoric which offers us protection in the face of global menace (see: TERROR). The situation is exacerbated by what sociologist Frank Furedi calls 'fear entrepreneurs' who stoke up threats with screaming headlines and pernicious adverts (Are you losing your hair?Are you UNFULFILLED by your JOB?'). We used to fear thunder and wild beasts: now seeing an advert in a newspaper or getting on a train seems to bring some new danger into focus.""",,,,,,,,,
22,Depaysement,Angst,"In February 1981 the French artist Sophie Calle was hired as a hotel chambermaid in Venice. Each day, under cover of cleaning the guests' rooms, she itemised and photographed the contents of their suitcases and bins. A postcard of the Basilica di San Marco. An Italian phrasebook with the page corner turned down. A torn-up love letter describing a trip to Harry's Bar. The resulting artwork, Hôtel, evokes the disorientation felt in foreign places. It tells of deciphering a strange language. Of stumbling again and again over the same landmark in unfamiliar streets, and the feelings of licence and anonymity which allow holiday romances to take flight. In France, the feeling of being an outsider is known as dépaysement (literally: decountrification). Sometimes it is frustrating, leaving us feeling unsettled and out of place. And then, just sometimes, it swirls us up into a kind of giddiness, only ever felt when far away from home. When the unlikeliest of adventures seem possible. And the world becomes new again. The French seem to be particularly intrigued by emotions to do with disorientation, see: ILINX and L'APPEL DU VIDE.",,,,,,,,,
23,Worry,Angst,"In the 1870s Samuel Smiles, self-help guru, emphasised the dangers of worrying. 'Cheerfulness, he wrote, 'enables nature to recruit its strength; whereas worry and discontent debilitate it.'In a world where being productive and improving oneself were important, succumbing to worry was emerging as rather irresponsible (see also: BOREDOM). It was against this backdrop that some of the apprehensiveness associated with worrying was carved off into a new medical condition: ANXIETY. More recent psychological research has cautioned against always assuming worry is a problem. Catastrophising may be counter-productive, but sometimes worrying can be an imaginative process. Examining our problems allows new ideas to come into focus and existing ones to rearrange themselves. Some researchers have even suggested that there may be a 'worry gene', since while stress and anxiety may shorten lives, those who experience the lower-level, more optimal emotion of worry seem to live longer and reproduce more. So perhaps we should welcome at least some of our worries.",,,,,,,,,
24,L'Appel du Vide,Angst,"Walking along a high cliff path, you are gripped by a terrifying urge to leap. As an express train hurtles into view, you itch to fling yourself in front of it. People talk of a fear of heights, but in truth anxieties about precipices are often less to do with falling than the horrifying compulsion to jump ... In Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), what paralyses James Stewart as he chases the suicidal Kim Novak up those rickety stairs is not dizziness. Hitchcock's clever camera trick which makes the bottom of the stairwell swim into the foreground, also makes its vanishing point alluring. Stewart is terrified he might just give in. The French have a name for this unnerving impulse: l'appel du vide; 'the call of the void'. Perhaps it is a kind of terrifying game the mind plays, a test serving to remind us how close danger is. But most of all, as Jean-Paul Sartre recognised, l'appel du vide creates an unnerving, shaky sensation of not being able to trust one's own instincts. And the fear that our emotions, with their impish irrational impulses, might be capable of leading us very far astray.",,,,,,,,,
25,Lonliness,Heartache,"There is a long tradition of suspicion towards those who choose to be alone. But in the eighteenth century, Romantic poets and painters deliberately sought loneliness out, believing that the physical condition of solitude could give rise to transformative spiritual experiences. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, 'loneliness' shifted from physical isolation to painful emotion. Characters in novels began to talk of their dejection. The modern metropolis, rather than the countryside, became the main source of loneliness. Today, politicians decry an 'epidemic of loneliness' in our cities, rising divorce rates, increased use of computers, the supposed solipsism of our culture and a lack of community identity are all blamed. But there is another kind of loneliness. In Japan, hikikomori (withdrawn) is a condition afflicting mainly adolescent, middle-class males in which sufferers, feeling alienated from their family's often traditional values, isolate themselves in their bedrooms and refuse to come out. One feeling of loneliness gives way to another. And reminds us that loneliness is not only a feeling which comes when we are lost in the great wilderness of the world, but also comes when we feel hemmed in by its expectations and desires.",,,,,,,,,
26,Sadness,Heartache,"During the Renaissance, a familiarity with gloom was thought of as a lesson in resilience. There was even a self-help book, The Castel of Helth written by Thomas Elyot in 1534, that suggested reasons to be more sad. Such a suggestion is unlikely to sell in our happiness-obsessed self-help industry today - but perhaps the idea that we might have to learn the art of sadness still has resonance. The authors Allan Horwitz and Jerome Wakefield discuss the widely acknowledged 'epidemic' of depression. Though depression is certainly a real and serious illness, they suggest that in some cases ordinary sadness is being mis-diagnosed as major depressive disorder. Others have also recognised the dangers of seeing sadness as a problem to be medicated away as this might leave us poorly equipped to manage in the future. For the psychotherapist Susie Orbach, it sends a message that pain can't be borne, lived through and tolerated, robbing us of an ability to recognise sorrow as an enriching part of life. Sadness is the process through which we adjust to a new version of ourselves after loss or DISAPPOINTMENT. It protects us and gives us strength. As known during the Renaissance, if we see sadness as an unfamiliar creature, we will be less resilient to it - and more vulnerable to its more serious manifestations.",,,,,,,,,
27,Melancholy,Heartache,"The idea that melancholy might be both arty and dangerous has its feet firmly in the Renaissance. During this time, each person was thought to have a unique balance of four elemental humours: blood, choler, phlegm and melancholy. Dramatic events which roused strong passions were thought to impact most on the melancholy humour, turning ordinary unhappiness into a more serious disease - melancholia. Noxious fumes were sent to the brain, fogging the mind and the victim would be left with an inexplicable feeling of sorrow and DREAD. The melancholic vapours were thought to produce visions, which Robert Burton described as 'terrible monstrous fictions' in his famous account of the illness. But the Italian scholar Marsilio Ficino, argued that these fumes brought creative insights, and so a cult of melancholic genius flourished. Even if melancholy was the mark of genius, it could bring tortures. Burton, instead, made writing about melancholy his life's work, and in the end saw his studies as both the cause of, and the cure for, the illness.",,,,,,,,,
28,Boredom,Heartache,"Boredom is the most contrary of emotions. It's a combination of feeling trapped, inert and disinterested: there is a vague sense of wanting something to change, but we really can't say what. The boredom we know today was invented by the Victorians. The expansion of factories and offices produced a new way of dividing up the day and 'leisure time' was quickly conceived as a space for self-improvement. Finding oneself at a loose end was a mark of inadequacy. Doctors debated boredom's unsavoury health implications. Politicians vilified it as a social ill. Feminist campaigners and novelists pointed out the emotion's corrosive effects on middle- and upper-class women. Today, we ought to be boredom-free, with the constant stimulation of ever-smarter technologies. Yet boredom is still with us - and maybe that's not so bad. Turn off your smart phone, and you may find yourself slipping into that listlessness which gives rise to pleasant reverie and daydreams. There is no coincidence that many creative people have spoken of their own childhoods as immensely tedious. Their boredom propelled them to invent and imagine. It might just be, as the anthropologist Ralph Linton has argued, that the human capacity for being bored, rather than social or natural needs, lies at the root of man's cultural advance'.",,,,,,,,,
29,Mono No Aware,Heartache,"At the waning of the Japanese Heian period (794-1185), Murasaki Shikibu crafted The Tale of Genji. Often described as the world's first novel, the book is infused with a quiet feeling for life's transience, the way all living and even inanimate things fade and disappear, which produces a sensation called mono no aware (pronounced moh-noh noh ah-wah-ray). Mono no aware is literally translated as the pathos of things. It describes the sorrow and serenity that come with recognising the inevitability of change; the anticipatory grief of losses to come; and the piquancy added to pleasures by the knowledge that they must end. Mono no aware is also linked to an aesthetic sensibility: wabi-sabi. The principle of wabi-sabi evokes a special beauty found only in unfinished or imperfect things: a crack in a porcelain vase, the wilted edges of a fallen maple leaf. The Tale of Genjis tenth chapter The Sacred Tree'"," captures the wistful feeling evoked by transient beauty. Genji picks his way across a gloriously decaying reed plain to visit his lover for the last time. ""The autumn flowers were gone and insects hummed in the wintry tangles. A wind whistling through the pines brought snatches of music",' and the following morning," Genji departs with 'his sleeves wet with dew and tears.""",,,,,,
30,Awumbuk,Heartache,"There is an emptiness after visitors depart. The walls echo. The space which felt so cramped while they were here now seems weirdly large. And though there is often RELIEF, we can also be left with a muffled feeling - as if a fog has descended and everything seems rather pointless. The indigenous Baining people who live in the mountains of Papua New Guinea are so familiar with this experience that they name it awumbuk. They believe that departing visitors shed a kind of heaviness when they leave, so as to travel lightly. This oppressive mist hovers for three days, creating a feeling of distraction and inertia and interfering with the family's ability to tend to their home and crops. So once their guests have left, the Baining fill a bowl with water and leave it overnight to absorb the festering air. The next day, the family rises very early and ceremonially flings the water into the trees, whereupon ordinary life resumes.",,,,,,,,,
31,Nostalgia,Heartache,"In 1688 Johannes Hofer wrote about a mysterious disease which had broken out among Swiss soldiers fighting abroad. It began with being distracted by thoughts of home, before progressing to lethargy and SADNESS. Strange physical symptoms followed. Some soldiers died of the illness, wasting away from a refusal to eat. Hofer invented a new word to describe the disease, nostalgia - from the Greek nostos (a homecoming or return) and algos (pain). By the nineteenth century, nostalgia had become one of the most studied medical conditions in Europe, and the last person to be diagnosed and die from the disease was an American soldier fighting in France in 1918. Psychological studies have recently emphasised the benefits of indulging in nostalgic reflection, suggesting it increases our sense of existential meaning and social connectedness. Researchers in China have even noticed that nostalgic feelings are more common in colder weather, arguing that reminiscing may serve an evolutionary purpose by raising our body temperature. From deadly disease to health-giving pastime in less than a century: nostalgia ain't what it used to be.",,,,,,,,,
32,Saudade,Heartache,"It is thought that the Portuguese first learnt to speak of saudade (pronounced sow-dad, or sow-datch-eh in Brazil) in the thirteenth century. Ships set sail from the port of Lisbon and those left behind lived out their days scanning the horizon, longing for the return of their loved ones. Female troubadours sang of their soidade (the older spelling), their wistful lyrics expressing an ache for distant lovers, and the HAPPINESS of the past. Saudade is a melancholic yearning for someone, or something, which is far away or lost. It's always there, pulsing below the surface with its HOPEFULNESS tinged with GRIEF. There is a vague yearning, yet it is interlaid with resignation and the pleasure of remembering past joys. Some emotions are so intimately tied to a particular artistic form that it's impossible to think of them without it. MELANCHOLY and the blues. National pride and anthems. In the early nineteenth century, saudade found its modern form in fado music. Meaning fate' or 'destiny', fado was born on the cobbled alleys of Lisbon's Alfama district. Its sobbing guitars and yearning voices evoke the experience of poverty, loss and the unfaithfulness of lovers. Fado is supposed to cleanse the singer of saudades bittersweet melancholy too. So to sing fado is to matar saudades. Literally: to kill saudade.",,,,,,,,,
33,Rage,Heat,"The last twenty years have witnessed a proliferation of types of rage. There are violent clashes on the roads (road rage), swearing frenzies in supermarkets (trolley rage), in offices (mouse rage) and even while opening groceries (wrap rage). Perhaps the stresses and frustrations of modern life are giving rise to increased levels of ferocity: the more sources of rage, the more sorts we can distinguish. But at least part of what drives this desire to label our furies is that this emotion has become increasingly unacceptable. American psychologists have even created a new umbrella diagnosis: intermittent explosive disorder. The cure? Dull ANGER with anti-depressants. But what would a society without rage look like? The political theorist Hannah Arendt argued that 'only where there is reason to suspect that conditions could be changed and are not does rage arise. Only when our sense of justice is offended do we react with rage.' To attempt to 'cure' a person of it would deprive the sufferer of a capacity for defiance, and society of an opportunity for change. Rages are an important part of being human and involved in the world. If we can't have the occasional flare-up of mouse, or trolley, or wrap rage, then we can't have revolutions and riots either.",,,,,,,,,
34,Panic,Heat,"The word 'panic' originates from Greek mythology. It described a sudden, inexplicable TERROR felt by travellers in wild, uninhabited places, after stumbling across the deity Pan. Those who followed Pan's cult celebrated him with ecstatic parties and panic became linked with the sensation of being taken over by the force of a dangerous, collective irrationality (see also: ECSTASY). At the end of the nineteenth century, panic was a much-studied phenomenon among 'crowd psychologists' Gabriel Tarde and Gustave Le Bon believed that when an individual became part of a crowd, they regressed to an earlier primitive state where the boundaries between individuals were less stable. Today, we remain more vulnerable than ever to the panic of the mob. Conspiracy theories and rumours can break loose over Twitter. Security guards still use code words for 'fire' and 'unattended bag' when they speak over public tannoys. But perhaps more dangerous still may be the panic which could spread between smartphones and laptops, bouncing from satellite to satellite and leaving a tangle of chaos and confusion behind it.",,,,,,,,,
35,Vengefulness,Heat,"When our PRIDE is wounded by an insult, vengefulness gives us a chance to restore lost dignity. Today's historians argue that during the Middle Ages even though inflicting punishments was often a matter of individual honour, it was still a tightly regulated process. The rules required that the punishment be carefully matched with the crime. But with the expansion of the legal system in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, judges and courtiers were quick to portray vengefulness as unruly and dangerous - and official state punishment as morally superior. Did these efforts to discredit vengefulness work? The revenge tragedies', popular in the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean theatre suggest not. In these plays' dramatic battles between private vengeance and the public law, the latter emerges as inept, sometimes even corrupt, while the 'wild justice' of the vengeful is portrayed as ultimately more effective. Conflicted attitudes towards vengefulness still linger. Of course (of course!) we ought to rise above our desire to get even. Perhaps there is a strange admiration for those who daringly act on their vengeful impulses, while the rest of us dutifully submit - and perhaps feel a little paler as a result.",,,,,,,,,
36,Anger,Heat,"Anger is an unruly emotion. It includes simmering RESENTMENT, and fits of pique; tantrums caused by exasperation and sudden flares of RAGE. It can be frighteningly contained, or frenzied and violent. It can become abusive, yet, it also stokes political action and goads us into working harder. The idea that expressing anger is good for our health is not a modern one. The eleventh-century Islamic scholar In Butlan explained that since anger directed the body's heat to the extremities, it could revive those who had become bed-bound through illness. Four centuries later, Lluís Alcanyis reported a story about a doctor who treated a patient by continually reminding him of slights from the past: the patient recovered. Today's psychotherapists are more interested in trying to understand where anger comes from. A burst of RAGE can create a release of muscular tension, temporarily subduing other, often more uncomfortable emotions. Perhaps by erupting at someone else, we temporarily give ourselves some RELIEF. Psychoanalysts suggest anger can be a decoy, a flash-in-the-pan outburst that we might unconsciously prefer to the more painful feeling it masks.",,,,,,,,,
37,Irritation,Heat,"Irritation is a state of friction. Being rubbed up the wrong way can be a cutaneous or emotional experience, but neither language nor experience distinguishes between the two. The rash which chafes against a collar might create feelings of agitation and claustrophobia. The irritation which starts with frustrated desires leaves one uncomfortable in one's own skin. When we are irritated, any kind of contact seems too much, too bristling. In the sixteenth century, to irritate simply meant to stir or incite to action. But by the late eighteenth century the word irritation began to be used to describe a vexed feeling. Irritation wasn't always justified, though. A hundred or so years later, some Victorian physicians saw a tendency to be easily irritated as the mark of congenitally oversensitive (alcoholics, the insane, artists, dandies). During the American Civil War irritability was further characterised as an emotion of excess and distortions, when doctors described a condition they called irritable heart'. Symptoms included palpitations", chest pains, fatigue and shortness of breath. It was explained as a psychosomatic illness, neurasthenia - roughly equivalent to modern-day 'stress'. Today this link between irritation and irrationality is alive and well, and conventional wisdom teaches us not to take our own and other people's irritations too seriously," in case by scratching we aggravate them further.""",,,,
38,Impatience,Heat,"It was the upholsterer of the cardiologists Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman who first noticed how the chairs in the waiting room were fraying. There were patches of threadbare material, on the arms (suggesting drumming fingers), and on the front edges (suggesting antsy wriggling), while the back was as good as new. No one relaxed in these chairs. The patients, mostly successful, busy middle-aged men with blocked arteries and soaring blood pressures, were intolerant of the unproductive time they were made to spend there. These waiting-room chairs eventually led Friedman and Rosenman to the idea of the Type A personality in the 1950s. Type As were patients whose sense of'time urgency' was a constant pressure. They were always successful, ambitious and (literally) on the edges of their seats - and they were also much more likely to die of heart disease or strokes. Impatience, it seems, is more than being unable to wait. Those men were struggling with the part of themselves forced to be the patient - temporarily ceding control to another's expertise and schedule, and brought face to face with the UNCERTAINTY of their future in the process.",,,,,,,,,
39,Contempt,Heat,"Whether smirking, sneering, or turning away in cold indifference, being filled with contempt inflates us with a sense of superiority. Even at its mildest, contempt condescends with amused detachment. Some say contempt is a closed door, spelling the end of our relationship with those we feel it towards. But just as often, it can stir new conversations into life. Contempt can be a form of political protest for the disempowered. When disdain is expressed by those thought to have no business looking down on anyone, cosy privileges can be disrupted, and a realignment of power envisaged. In the twentieth century, contempt became a core strategy of protest culture. In 1911 suffragettes roller-skated the night away to avoid the census ( we don't count, we won't be counted'). More recently hundreds of women joined an online campaign based around 'mansplaining'- mocking the men who, assuming their female colleagues were less informed about a topic than they were, explained it to them in over-simplified terms. In the twentieth- and twenty-first-century history of women's rights, contempt has played a crucial role, laughing in the face of convention in the hope of shifting consciousness - or at least, getting a conversation started.",,,,,,,,,
40,Humiliation,Ego,"In 1863 Abraham Lincoln proclaimed 30 April 'a day of national humiliation. America, he argued, had become 'intoxicated with unbroken success... too self-sufficient... too proud. The civil war that had blighted the country had been God's retribution for this arrogance. Only penitence, prayer, fasting, all leading to a collective feeling of humility, could prevent similar atrocities in the future. At the time of Lincoln's speech, humiliation made you modest and respectful. But today, humiliation is something unwelcome, something punishing rather than actively sought out. It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment humiliation and humility began to part ways. Deliberately humiliating a prisoner is a gross violation of their human rights. But a request that we be humble? The demand made by some to 'check your privilege' has been criticised for stifling debate. But in the spirit in which it was originally intended, it is also a call to practise humility, to recognise the ways in which our own HAPPINESS and achievements might be the result of class, gender, race and luck, as much as hard work. This is a recognition that the good things in our lives are not always all of our own making, but depend on other people too.",,,,,,,,,
41,Pride,Ego,"We feel pride when we allow ourselves to be seen. It can fill us up so much that we burst, and tears follow, as when we are recognised with an award, or see our children flourish. Strange, then, that we have also come to think of pride as an emotion which blinds us too. Philosophers distinguish between false and true pride - and even if such moralistic tones can be off-putting there's something useful in this distinction. There are many reasons why even the pride that philosophers call true' has been treated with caution, and why it is considered a sin in most of the world's religions. Pride might blind us to our limitations, make us overreach and commit the sin the ancients called hubris, which comes before a fall. But the 'false' pride is different. It's there when we think we're backing ourselves, but are in fact, being defensive and brittle. This is the pride which makes us refuse help, or resist the urge to apologise. This is the pride that can't admit lack and loss, and which therefore makes it very hard to acknowledge one's truer self - the self which is partial, and dissatisfied and needy. This is the pride which is most common and least trusted of all.",,,,,,,,,
42,Feeling like a Fruad,Ego,"Are you faking your way through life? Have you fooled your boss into thinking you're more talented than you really are? Do you worry about being found out? Then you're not alone. In the 1970s two psychologists, Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes, investigating this torturous experience called it the Imposter Phenomenon. They found it was particularly common among successful professional women, many of whom believed their achievements had been the result of accident or oversight. Today, many successful men also admit to feeling like an imposter, and it's particularly common among first-generation professionals or those embarking on a career change. Feeling like a fraud is undoubtedly an unpleasant experience, but as high-profile high-achievers become more vocal about their own feelings of imposterism (in recent years the former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and the novelist Maya Angelou have both admitted to experiencing it), it may be that feeling like a fraud is being recast as an inevitable growing pain - less something to buckle under than a feeling we must learn to bear.",,,,,,,,,
43,Confidence,Ego,"Confidence always dazzles. We might feel a stab of envy around those who glide effortlessly into the party, shake hands, charm all the important people (everybody laughs at their jokes!). But as much as other people's lack of self-doubt shimmers with mystery - and perhaps mild suspicion: can they be trusted? - our own confident feelings are often frustratingly elusive. By the 1970s, self-help gurus were claiming that the only difference between you and that charismatic individual for whom doors swung wide open was confidence. And how to get it? You had to use a simple bit of magical thinking: fake it till you make it. Was it a little contemptuous? If it was, then we were the real target of the con. Not least, because the mantra may have also spawned a belief that confidence could be a reasonable substitute for competence. Studies have shown that if we continually pretend to be a person we're not, we lose faith in the abilities that we do have - or else feel terrified that we'll be found out (see: FRAUD, FEELING LIKE A). What's more, too much confidence can inhibit the desire for self-improvement. Perhaps instead of chasing that glorious sensation of invincibility, we might put some trust in quieter feelings, and learn to love UNCERTAINTY, hesitation and confusion too.",,,,,,,,,
44,Courage,Ego,"During medieval times, it was thought that courage could be cultivated by shaping one's life according to four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude. Fortitude described a steadfastness, an ability to take responsibility for one's actions. According to Thomas Aquinas, courage was not just an ability to 'stand immovable in the midst of dangers' without succumbing to the desire to attack, but also the patience to endure pain with equanimity, to have a 'strength of hope' and a feeling of 'magnificence'-treating all our endeavours with sincerity and importance. Today's talk of courage is indebted to this flexible, inclusive medieval concept. When we admire the bravery of individuals, it is not only because they are willing to put themselves in harm's way, but also because they risk social exclusion. The brave speak out against injustice, or stand up for their beliefs when threatened by oppression. But, perhaps it's the emphasis on psychological fortitude, the ability to confront one's demons or flourish despite the scars of trauma, which most recalls the medieval way of thinking about courage.",,,,,,,,,
45,Embarrassment,Ego,"If you're easily embarrassed, you probably envy those who allow their gaffes to roll right off them. But maybe we're being too hard on ourselves. According to the sociologist Erving Goffman, embarrassment serves an important purpose. Getting Austered shows that we realise we've transgressed a social rule, and recent research from the University of California has shown that people who are more easily embarrassed are also more altruistic. Because of this connection between embarrassment and maintaining social equilibrium, the philosopher Rom Harré has argued that embarrassment has taken over from sHaME as the major instrument of conformity. Charles Darwin ventured that, since breaking taboos leaves us feeling conspicuous, blushing - embarrassment's famous tell - may have evolved as a reflex, a deterrent to rule-breaking helping fledgling societies survive. But embarrassment doesn't always work in the way evolutionary psychologists like Darwin and Goffman suggest. Sometimes embarrassment can inhibit generosity, as when we resist the urge to offer our seat on a bus for fear of drawing attention to ourselves. Embarrassment might cement our social rules, but can accidentally make us break them too.",,,,,,,,,
46,Uncertainty,Possibility,"Uncertainty is often characterised as an unpleasant emotional experience, one we are motivated to avoid. Feeling doubtful at life's biggest junctions can be hard to tolerate. Yet, though predictability temporarily salves us, hesitations and doubts are part of the architecture of our lives. Even the most advanced theoretical physicists can't give us answers. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, it's impossible to know both the size and mass of a particle at any one time, since each time you try to measure one, the other changes. If this is the condition of our subatomic universe, you can bet it's the condition of our day-to-day lives too. Freedom, serendipity, creativity: these are the delights of uncertainty. Not knowing an outcome can be immensely pleasurable. According to many artists, the DESIRE to find out must be resisted. Only those 'capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason, wrote the poet John Keats, are truly free to create and explore. Allow yourself to get lost, and you might glimpse that freedom too.",,,,,,,,,
47,Curiosity,Possibility,"It's the itch to find out more. The temptation to glance at an open diary, or strain to decipher an argument behind you on the bus. It's the restless DESIRE that made Leonardo da Vinci ask: What makes birds Ay? How does the heart beat? Without curiosity, it's hard to imagine creativity or invention at all. Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that our natural curiosity about one another is one key to our evolutionary success. But that doesn't make us any happier to be on the receiving end of someone else's. Curosity can overreach. It stumbles into forbidden knowledge, not stopping to think whether what emerges will be hurtful. Five centuries ago in England, eavesdropping was illegal. Today, it is the surreptitious accumulation of 'intimate capital, the photographs and snippets of information used for blackmail and by tabloid journalists, which must be policed. Suspicion of other people's curiosity is nicely captured by the Swedish word for an eavesdropper: a tjuvlyssnare, a 'listen-thief. Lurking and snatching poorly guarded secrets"," the listen-thief profits - with the titillations of forbidden knowledge or simply cold hard cash.""",,,,,,,,
48,Wanderlust,Possibility,"Perhaps it begins with a restless twitch. Perhaps with a fascination with a distant country or landscape, a kind of yearning for a place you've never visited but have seen pictures of. We may long to leave a footprint on a glacier, or hear an echo of our voice across a lake at dawn, but perhaps most of all we want to experience the world made new again. The German word Wanderlust (the pleasure of hiking) first came out of a defiant Romantic tradition of solitary walking (see: LONELINESS). In the 1880s, the idea that humans might have a natural desire to roam was a popular one. Evolutionary theory had suggested that the human body could play host to ancient impulses. Though Victorians may have feared the eruption of the nomadic instinct, in small doses it was welcomed. Not least because its discovery coincided with the birth of the modern tourist industry. With Cook's Tours, and the publication of the first tourist guides (the Baedeker series), and the popularity of exotic travellers tales from the likes of Jules Verne and Mark Twain, Europeans had never been more ready to be on the move. We are the inheritors of this late-nineteenth century moment of fascination with Wanderlust. In it we find a craving for adventure and discovery, which just as it propels us towards the future, reminds us of our ancient pasts.",,,,,,,,,
49,Hopefulness,Possibility,"When the sociologist Barbara Ehrenreich was diagnosed with breast cancer, she was surprised how coercive she found the insistence to keep optimistic. Her subsequent account Smile or Die describes how the positive psychology movement, which insists on a link between a positive attitude and improved well-being, has co-opted hope. Can hope really press back the march of cancerous cells? There's probably no harm in finding out. Except that Ehrenreich also cites a 2004 study which suggests that continually looking on the bright side of a cancer diagnosis did not always help patients. A hopeful outlook might make life easier for carers and family members, but many of the patients themselves found it alienating, even GUILT-inducing, and it prevented them from acknowledging and expressing the FEAR and ANGER they also felt. The idea that hope can be manufactured at will seems at odds with what hopefulness so often feels like. With its flickering promise of a happier ending, it is a glimpse of RELIEF in a desperate situation, when we have reached the end of all that we might practically do. We know hoping might leave us feeling cheated and let down, but this vulnerability is also a strength. To feel hope is to acknowledge how little control we so often have.",,,,,,,,,
50,Anticipation,Possibility,"Anticipation is a tiny theft of pleasure. A reckless spending of delights not yet owned. Until the mid-nineteenth century, an anticipation was a sum of money spent before it was earned: an early payout on the dowry; an advance on next week's wages. Perhaps it's this whiff of the scandalous ('neither a borrower nor a lender be!) which makes some adults firmly budget their children's expectations. Or perhaps, it's just their familiarity with the effects of DISAPPOINTMENT. Looking forward to an event is one thing. Savouring in technicolour detail what will happen when the lights dim and the curtain goes up, or the birthday present is finally opened, is, however, not for the fainthearted Anticipation is an exquisite torture. It's there in the hands poised to tickle, or in the scent of baking which curls through the house. It may be that the cake comes out flat, or the game abruptly ends when foreheads painfully bump. But it doesn't really matter. In those brief moments of anticipation, the pleasure is absolute and sublime.",,,,,,,,,
51,Ilinx,Enjoyment,"There's a peculiar exhilaration in the idea of picking up a pile of loose papers, opening the window and flinging them all out. Or intentionally smashing a delicate china cup. Or in standing on a kitchen chair and tipping out a bag of marbles so that they crash, bounce and roll across the floor. According to the twentieth-century French sociologist Roger Caillois, the 'strange excitement' of wanton destruction was one way of experiencing the feeling he named ilinx (from the Greek word for whirlpool). He defined ilinx as a 'voluptuous panic, a sensation of spinning, falling and losing control - the sort of feeling which riding a rollercoaster might produce. Callois traced ilin back to the practices of ancient mystics who by whirling and dancing hoped to induce rapturous trance states and glimpse alternative realities (see: ECSTASY). Today, even succumbing to the urge to create a minor chaos by kicking over the office recycling bin should give you a mild hit.",,,,,,,,,
52,Surprise,Enjoyment,"In 1872 Charles Darwin conducted a curious experiment at London Zoo. Standing before a tank containing a deadly adder, Darwin thrust his nose against the glass with the firm determination of not starting back if the snake struck. No sooner had the angry reptile lunged at the glass than Darwin skittered several paces backwards. The fact that so many of our feelings rise up without our permission is part of what makes them both exasperating and alluring. It was these moments which particularly intrigued Charles Darwin. He wondered if these unnecessary emotional responses were vestiges, emotional habits left over from much earlier times. Darwin's theory called into question the cherished idea that our emotions express some innermost part of ourselves, replacing it with a picture of human feelings shaped by vast forces, which stretched far beyond the margins of our individual lives. He showed us that our emotions don't entirely belong to us. And that though we might fondly imagine ourselves to be the drivers of our bodies, we are more like passengers, along for a ride.",,,,,,,,,
53,Glee,Enjoyment,"Glee has never been entirely innocent. When the Norsemen arrived in England, bringing their language with them, gly, or glíw, or glew meant 'sport' and 'mockery. Today glee retains a dastardly edge. After a series of security leaks in 2013, the Head of MI6 imagined Al-Qaeda terrorists 'rubbing their hands with glee. This glee is a malevolent thrill, a celebration of one's own good fortune (see: SCHADENFREUDE). Body language experts disagree about the origins of gleeful hand-rubbing, though all link it to anticipating something good coming our way. Standing around in a cold cave, our ancestors would rub their hands together to make the blood circulate faster and more nimbly pick at roasting meat. Or: it is a way of dissipating anxious tension. Or: it's a version of a baby's delighted clap. Or: it echoes cleansing hands before receiving a gift. But why then should it have become associated with Hollywood super-villains? The answer can be found in John Bulwer's 1644 guide to hand gestures, which links hand-rubbing to the cleansing of imagined bloodstains - as Lady Macbeth might be found doing. Actors resorted to rubbing their hands to tip off the audience that their character, who seemed oh so innocent, was in fact very villainous indeed.",,,,,,,,,
54,Desire,Enjoyment,"Whether we covet a person, or an object, or something intangible like 'fame' or 'glory', people have long recognised the dangers of being gripped by desire. It was a long time since I had longed for anything, wrote Samuel Beckett, 'and the effect on me was horrible? Perhaps it's because desire runs so close to FEAR that it can feel so uncomfortable. The habit among theologians, doctors and even sexologists to attribute our desires to some other part of ourselves - something the Devil sent, or the product of a diseased mind, or even a biological instinct - may be partly a response to how uncomfortable longing can be. Perhaps our urges frighten us because they might lead us astray, hurting those we love and disrupting the status quo. Perhaps we suspect we idealise the desired object, and fear the tumult we'll create. Part of what makes desire so hard to tolerate is the frustration and DISAPPOINTMENT which so often come with it. But perhaps more hidden is its SHAME: the way longing for someone exposes us, forcing us to admit we lack something that we don't already have and can't easily obtain.",,,,,,,,,
55,Excitement,Enjoyment,"When the word 'excitement' first appeared in English in the eighteenth-century, it was a condition of the 'vital spirits', which when 'excited' would whizz around the body. It wasn't until the nineteenth century that excitement became an emotion. Charles Darwin spoke of excitement as 'high spirits', which registered in bright eyes, rapid circulation and whirlwind ideas. One of his contemporaries Alexander Bain added that it was an 'emotion of action', it gave one a feeling of momentum, invincibility and speed. The story of excitement took a new direction in the 1890s. Dr George Oliver was a physician in the habit of performing experiments on his family. In one, he injected his young son with a purified extract of sheep and calf adrenal glands - the boy's radial artery suddenly contracted, sending his blood pressure rocketing. Within ten years, the word 'hormone' had been coined and the substance Oliver had used was being marketed as a new wonder-drug: Adrenaline. Adrenaline didn't only catch the attention of surgeons, the era's psychologists became interested in the way it caused a kind of urgent feeling, sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks. In adrenaline, they had found the secret of excitement - and the theory that our emotions might be chemical responses to life's crises was secured.",,,,,,,,,
56,Ecstasy,Enjoyment,"Ecstasy paralyses us with a quivering pleasure. It feels as if the world has billowed open. As if we have, momentarily, been set free. Such experiences have been at the heart of spiritual life for millennia. The nuns of medieval Europe scourged their flesh and fasted to be rewarded with visions. The Shamans of Siberia spun and danced till spirits appeared to lead them into other worlds. But the disenchantment of ecstasy began when nineteenth-century neurologists recategorised ecstatic states from rare and sought-after emotions to the by-products of nervous diseases. Today's neurologists speak of kalopsia, a feeling that everything is intensely beautiful and radiant, and say it is caused by lesions in the right parietal cortex of the brain. Or of 'autoscopic phenomena' during which one's own body is seen in outside space - thought to be caused by damage either to the parieto-occipital cortex or temporo-parietal junction. And so, much that used to be part of the rapturous ecstasy of lovers and mystics is now reduced to defunct brain wiring.",,,,,,,,,
57,Fago,Bliss,"'The implicit poetry in Ifaluk emotional understandings is nowhere more evident than in the concept of fago,' wrote the anthropologist Catherine Lutz in the late 1980s. While living among the people of Ifaluk, a tiny coral atoll in the Caroline Islands of the Pacific, Lutz became fascinated by an emotion which she instinctively recognised but for which there was no English equivalent. Fago is an emotional concept that blurs compassion, SADNESS and LOVE together. It is the pity felt for someone in need, which compels us to care for them, but it is also haunted by a strong sense that one day we will lose them. Fago comes in those moments when our love for others, and their need for us, feels so unexpectedly overwhelming - and life so very fragile and temporary - that we well up. Lutz suggested that the fact the Ifaluk, who are famed for their non-aggression, have a distinct emotion to describe a combination of sorrow and the compassion which might go some way to relieving it, points to the importance of mutual concern in their culture. It also alerts us to the inevitability of GRIEF in all human life.",,,,,,,,,
58,Love,Bliss,"We may wax lyrical about love, but we are often struck dumb by it too. One of the oldest examples of love's inarticulacy is left by the poet Sappho who lived around the sixth century BCE. She glimpses her beloved and falls into a kind of paralysis: my lost voice stutters, / Refuses to come back / Because my tongue is shattered. The Occitan troubadours of the eleventh and twelfth centuries sang of their yearning for unobtainable lovers. Sometimes it was through the wordlessness of a breath", a sigh or a yawn, that their love could find its best expression. A testament to long devotion. These silences are still part of the way we love. In the squeeze of a hand, or a shared look across a room. In the word 'love' itself. This word carries immense meaning: can it describe the same emotion we feel for lovers, loyal friends, Gods, long-term partners, parents or pets? We have only this one syllable - vague, open to misinterpretation. So we shrug our shoulders. It's just," you know ... Love."""
59,Happiness,Bliss,"Happiness is a multimillion-pound industry. Self-help books encourage us to track our emotional temperatures. Apps turn the effects of certain foods and exercise on our moods into graphs. But in our hurry to weigh and measure that most subjective, fleeting experience of happiness, we might be forgetting to check first what we're putting at risk. The idea that happiness is obligatory, that we have failed if we can't achieve it, can make us anxious and dissatisfied. One response to this dilemma is to reject the term altogether. Many contemporary philosophers and psychologists prefer to use the term 'flourishing'. While happiness has come to be associated with a generalised positive feeling, to lead a flourishing life demands that you practise COURAGE, compassion and deferred gratification for a more satisfying way to live. Perhaps the greatest consequence of replacing talk of happiness with talk of flourishing will be to restore happiness to its rightful place as an emotion: a temporary feeling which, like all emotions, may sometimes be present and sometimes not.",,,,,,,,,
60,Cheerfulness,Bliss,"Disneyworld: it's 'the happiest place on earth'. To work there, you must learn how to maintain beaming smiles and infectious enthusiasm; manage facial expressions and gestures; transform your inner monologue; and convert feelings of frustration and RESENTMENT into enthusiasm and DELIGHT. Can trying to act upbeat when you don't actually feel upbeat really work? There is some evidence which suggests that contorting your face into a grin might truly influence the emotions you feel. But some psychologists and sociologists have questioned the long-term effects of sustaining a workplace rictus smile. Disney employees, like many others who work in service industries where 'surface acting' positive emotions is explicitly demanded, have been shown to be at greater risk of burnout. In our increasingly flexible, consumer-focused economy, it's worth asking whether we should take compulsory cheerfulness more seriously. Since 'emotional labour'is thought to contribute to increased levels of stress and symptoms associated with depression and ANXIETY among employees, we may find that the pressure to be cheerful leads to dissatisfaction, exhaustion and alienation. Have a nice day!",,,,,,,,,
61,Satisfaction,Bliss,"We smile for all sorts of reasons, but one smile has a particularly intriguing history: the smile of satisfaction. It can be full of triumph, irritatingly smug or ironic and wry. But whichever form these satisfied grins take, they enjoyed a moment in eighteenth-century France, when Parisians learnt - briefly - how to smile. According to the historian Colin Jones, this 'smile revolution' can be traced back to a group of philosophers active in the mid-century. These philosophers presented themselves as free, enquiring and happy. For them, a smile was the ideal emotional attitude with which to greet the world. 'One must laugh at everything, said Voltaire. This was not a man plagued by DESIRE or doubt, but one curious and quietly confident. The philosophes called the feeling 'satisfaction', from the Latin satis (enough) facere (to do). The word originally meant the fulfilment of debt or obligation. In the writing of eighteenth-century philosophes it came to mean the contentment of using one's skills appropriately, foreshadowing today's career-speak of job satisfaction'. French aristocrats embraced an attitude of satisfaction. Satisfied smiles lit up the walls of Versailles", symbols of progressiveness and the ability to afford expensive dentistry. Whether philosophes or aristocrats, however, Parisians didn't enjoy their self-satisfied smiles for very long. By the time of the September massacres of 1792," they were more commonly depicted wearing violent screams instead.""",,,,,
62,Euphoria,Bliss,"In 1896 the physician Théodule Ribot noted that some patients experienced states of ecstatic bliss at the end of their lives, laughing delightedly, leaping out of bed, seemingly oblivious to the imminence of their demise. These patients perplexed, even outraged, doctors, who dismissed the sudden outburst of euphoria as a sign of degeneracy. In 1926 physicians found that over two-thirds of patients in the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis experienced a prevailing mood of serenity and cheerfulness. Today, only thirteen per cent of patients suffering the same disease report feeling anything close to euphoric. Why? Perhaps the methods of assessing mood are to blame, or maybe medication. It also seems likely that social factors play their role. Early in 2013, when Wilko Johnson announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer, the press pounced on his descriptions of feeling 'vividly alive' with a 'strange euphoria' and 'marvellous feeling of freedom. His interviews, though intensely uplifting, disconcertingly undermined our own calcified notions of HaPPIness and where we should find it.",,,,,,,,,
63,Warm Glow,Zen,"Most of us walk off feeling a little bouncier after helping carry a stranger's pram up the stairs, or bringing in a neighbour's shopping. Random acts of kindness give a feeling of solidarity of the 'we're all in this together variety, even a swell of pRIDe. Yet, though we say it's my pleasure? after someone thanks us, the English language has not yet dignified this pleasure with a name. Some have suggested 'Altru-hedonism'. Slightly less ugly is the phrase suggested by the Victorian philosopher Herbert Spencer (not known for being pithy): 'altruistic pleasure'. With this sort of competition, it might be that 'a warm glow is still the best term we have. Recent research into altruism has suggested that one of the key pleasure pathways of the brain, the mesolimbic system which carries dopamine to the areas associated with reward, is engaged when we donate to charity in the same way as it is when we receive money ourselves. The MRI images which accompany these studies depict our brains glowing, quite literally, with the pleasure of giving: 'nature's reward' for behaviour which will help our species survive.",,,,,,,,,
64,Empathy,Zen,"What today is called 'empathy, the sentimental philosophers of the eighteenth century called 'sympathy, which they saw evidence for in the physical flinches and winces that occur when people witness the pain of others. The promise of inbuilt sympathy led to an astonishing cult of benevolence and 'benevolists soon began to grapple with the ills of their age - slavery, child labour, animal cruelty - with utopian fever. But, it was a brief flourishing of kindness. By the end of the century tender-hearted 'moral weeping' was being satirised for its self-indulgence, and the word 'sentimentality began to accrue the associations with inauthenticity and mawkishness it has today. Today's empathy is a feeling of emotional resonance between people and it is much celebrated as a 'universal solvent' (according to the psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, 'any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble'). In emotional-literacy classes in British schools, children are taught empathy, so that alongside language and numbers a capacity for vicarious feeling is becoming an expected indicator of a child's development. Has the twenty-first century's interest in empathy engendered a similar wave of philanthropy? When our politicians speak of a 'politics of empathy, it's hard not to feel cynical. But if we are shrivelled by narcissism and in the grip of a compassion deficit, then we might just have to hope that empathy can build the bridges some promise it can.",,,,,,,,,
65,Delight,Zen,"The hands clap, the eyes sparkle, the lips tingle into a smile. Sparked so often by sensory pleasures - the hoare-frost on a spider's web, a petal's startling pink - delight is a moment of fleshy abandon and almost spiritual transcendence. In many cultures, gardens have been credited with bringing forth its raptures. In fifteenth-century Islamic art, the delights of paradise are depicted as jewel-like gardens. From the Zen rock gardens of ancient Japan to Hieronymus Bosch's strawberry-drenched The Garden of Earthly Delights, the garden encapsulates a glistening, sensory presence. For the eighteenth-century English philosopher John Locke, delight was one of the four essential feelings out of which all complex emotions grew the others were pleasure, pain and uneasiness). Delight comes from the Latin delectare (to allure, to charm, to entice away, and Locke described it as a kind of shimmering seduction. It was, he said, that intangible thing which caused a person to say they love' something: as in 'I love the apple tree' or I love the sky. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the change of spelling during the sixteenth century from the older 'delite' to the modern 'delight' was the result of an accident. But as is so often the case, the mistake captures the essence of the thing: luminosity and weightlessness seem to be at the heart of delight, which most of all, makes one feel like flying.",,,,,,,,,
66,Comfort,Zen,"In the 1950s paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott became interested in the practice of giving babies something soft to cuddle. He suggested that these 'transitional objects' must have warmth, texture and movement, allowing the child to imbue them with a life of their own, acting as a 'bridge' between the baby's mind and the real world. Once the baby has learnt to understand the distinction between themselves and others, the object's usefulness fades. Yet, our need for transitional objects never disappears entirely. From the Latin confortare (to strengthen), seeking comfort is no weakness. But as adults, it can be hard to admit to vulnerability. Sometimes we might feel brave enough to seek reassurance from others, or we might find solace furtively. According to Winnicott, paintings and films, prayers and rituals, even addictions and compulsions all perform the same function as teddy bears. They allow the unforgiving outside world to temporarily yield to and mirror our painful inner emotional landscapes. They allow us to say, Yes, that's exactly how I feel.' And there is little more consoling than that.",,,,,,,,,
67,Calm,Zen,"When ANXIETY sends shocks behind the eyes, or FEAR thuds in the chest, or LOVE is so rapturous we think we'll lose our footing, we long to conjure what we think is our 'normal' state of calm. Today, smoothing the mind's scratchy edges is largely achieved by pharmaceuticals. But in the 1960s, it looked as if neurotechnology might just beat the drugs to it. Though requiring an invasive procedure, celebrated neuroscientist José Delgado thought his electronic implants might offer an elegant solution to disordered emotions. Emotion modification experiments recorded in 1965 show the unarmed scientist in a bull ring in Cordoba, Spain. In one hand he holds a matador's cape; in the other, a small remote-control box. A bull snorts and stamps on the ground. It charges towards the scientist. Only moments from being gored, Delgado flicks a switch which controls an electronic chip embedded in the bull's brain. The animal stops and turns away, passive and relaxed. Its 'aggression' and destructive fury'", reported Delgado," 'ceased instantly. It's when emotions get too much that we may fantasise about one of Delgado's remote controls. One woman from Rhode Island Asylum with a history of drug abuse and jail time begged Delgado to implant one of his electrodes. He refused.""",,,,,,,
68,Relief,Zen,"Relief is not always a straightforwardly happy feeling. The moments following a close call on the motorway are a heart-thumping adrenalin rush. At the end of a long project, the relief of finishing may be spiked with disappointment. And as often as we exhale with a 'Phew!', many of us might also find ourselves inexplicably weeping on receiving good news after a long and anxious wait. The idea that tears accompany relief is an ancient one, stretching back to Aristotle's theory of catharsis. Sometimes, the physical act of weeping itself seems to purify, leaving us quieter and lighter inside. As the Jewish proverb puts it 'what soap is for the body, tears are for the soul'. More recently theories have suggested weeping relieves us because the liquid flowing from our tear ducts flushes hormones or toxins away. But since when we weep we discharge little more than a millilitre of fluid, this seems unlikely. Perhaps the truth is that weeping leaves us feeling the relief of our emotions being made visible. Think of the feeling of unburdening yourself by telling a secret or confessing to guilt. We might feel lighter, but this may be less because we have expressed our anxieties than because we experience the solace of being listened to and understood. In this sense, relief might be less about something being flushed away than about our feelings finally being seen. For more on weeping, see: EMPATHY.",,,,,,,,,
